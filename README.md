# Pathage - An Online Library of TSP Solvers
The Pathage is a Flask based server that allows its users to run different types of TSP solvers (e.g. concorde, ortools, ML/DL solvers, etc.).
- Users are welcome to input their TSP (x,y) coordinate data through file or text input on the web page.
- Users are also welcome to select various TSP solvers and inference the solution of input TSP data.
- Finally, users can check out resulting TSP solutions visually.

# What is TSP (Traveling Salesman Problem)?
The travelling salesman problem, also known as the travelling salesperson problem (TSP), asks the following question: "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?" It is an NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization, important in theoretical computer science and operations research. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem)
